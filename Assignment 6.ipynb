    "# 2. What do the escape characters n and t stand for?\n",
    "Ans:> In Python strings, the backslash \"\\\" is a special character, also called the \"escape\" character. It is used in representing certain whitespace characters: \"\\t\" is a tab, \"\\n\" is a newline, and \"\\r\" is a carriage return. ... This is called \"escaping\". For example, \"\\'\" is the single quote character.\n"

    "Ans:> If you want an actual backslash in the string or regex, you have to write two: \\\\ . If you're using a string to create a regular expression (rather than using a regular expression literal as I did above), note that you're dealing with two levels: The string level, and the regular expression level.\n"
